### About me

I'm actually a student in computer science at the University of Le Havre Normandie. This year is my last year of master's degree in computer science at the university. But this year I also joined the IES Ingénierie team by becoming an analyst developer in work-study training.

- 🤓  Continually learning SwiftUI.
- 💬  Ask me about iOS development, Swift, accessibility.
- 📫  How to reach me: kaya@hey.com or Twitter [@kthomas901](twitter.com/kthomas901)
- 🍂  From a very young age, I have always had a passion for animals and nature
- 🦖  Fun fact: I love dinosaurs, so I'm also passionate about paleontology
