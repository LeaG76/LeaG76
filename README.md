### About me

<p>I'm a French <b>Full-Stack developer</b> 👩‍💻 who is passionate about web design, and for the past few months, I have been increasingly interested in the UX and UI design aspects. I hold a master's degree in computer science, and during this program, I gained skills in website development, particularly focusing on the back-end and various programming languages. However, it's the front-end of the web that interests me more, so I self-trained in web design. Now, I enjoy crafting projects from A to Z, starting with designing the layout and then proceeding to web development. I hope you enjoy my web designs, giving you an insight into my web design and development skills.</p>

- 🍂 I'm currently working on creating my own visual identity and portfolio
- 🌻 I'm currently learning the basics of UX/UI design and improving with the Figma tool 
- 🥨 I'd like to learn how to use PhotoShop and improve my design (creation of logos and graphic elements)
- ☕ Personal projects: I have lots of projects in mind but my main project is the creation of a cooking recipe site
- 🐿️ From a very young age, I have always had a passion for animals and nature
- 🦖 Fun fact: I love dinosaurs, so I'm also passionate about paleontology
