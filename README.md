## About me

I’m an iOS developer, writer and public speaker. I'm the creator of [We Read Too](wereadtoo.com), a book resource app that features books for kids and teens with main characters of colors written by Black, Latinx, Asian and Indigenous authors. I'm currently a Leaders for Global Operation Fellow at MIT pursuing a dual degree MBA and Masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering. Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Calm and a iOS Engineer at Slack. 

- 📱  I’m currently working on We Read Too.
- 🤓  Continually learning SwiftUI.
- 💬  Ask me about iOS development, Swift, accessibility.
- 📫  How to reach me: kaya@hey.com or Twitter [@kthomas901](twitter.com/kthomas901)
- 😄  Pronouns: she/her
- 🚴🏽‍♀️  Fun fact: I love cycling, I've done a century ride of 108 miles from Oakland to Sacramento and completed 2 triathlons.
